        This website only serves to calculate costs for the accounting subject, and serves as a very simple way you just have to fill in the spaces and this calculator will add them for you.<br>
        <center>But what do all these formulas mean and how do I get them out?</center><br><br>


1: Well the cousin cost: They are direct materials and direct labor. These costs are directly related to production. For example, the cost of labor (doctors, nurses, etc.) and direct materials (examination and treatment.) And just as its meaning says it occupies the raw material and labor in order to obtain it.<br><br>

2: Indirect costs: The indirect cost is one of the types of costs that affects the production process of one or several products that the company subsequently sells. But what really characterizes these costs is that they can not be assigned directly to each of the products. That is, if you produce cars, you know that in each car, you will need as raw material, 4 wheels, for example. However, this is not possible to do with the indirect costs. It will be done only after having defined a coherent allocation criterion, which allows you to calculate your allocation to each product individually, which will guide you later when defining the final sale price. To calculate this, you only use the prime cost (the result of the previous sum), direct manufacturing overhead and indirect costs.<br><br>
        
        3: Cost of production: This is the set of expenses that are necessary to produce a service or a good. The cost of production, therefore, is made up of all the investments that a company must make in order to continue operating and produce what it commercializes. To do this sum you have prime cost (the result of the first sum), direct overhead and indirect costs (which is the result of the sum 2).<br><br>

4: Distribution Costs: The distribution costs are all the expenses incurred by a producer to deliver their products, from their manufacturing plant to the place where they are acquired. To solve this you have sales expenses and administration expenses.<br><br>

5: Total cost of operation: The concept of total cost, in this framework, refers to the total costs of a company. To solve this form, you only have to pay for production cost and distribution cost<br><br>

6: Unit cost of population: The concept of total cost, in this framework, refers to the totality of the costs of a company. To occupy to divide the cost of production and that of units produced.<br><br>
